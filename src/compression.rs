//! # Compression
//!
//! Leverage common compression algorithms for lossless data compression.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Compression framework enables your app to provide lossless compression
//! when saving or sharing files and data. Compression is a process in which
//! you compress (encode) and decompress (decode) data. For example, a text
//! editor may save its files in a compressed format, and automatically
//! decompress the saved file when opened by the user.
